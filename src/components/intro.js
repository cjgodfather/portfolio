        A strong creative thinker who has a keen interest in all things related
        to Internet and programming. I am able to develop web applications with
        languages such as JavaScript and Python and also passionate about
        learning new things and solving problems in a creative way. Currently, I
        am looking for opportunities as a junior front-end or back-end developer
        with organizations that could not only take him to another programming
        level but also allow him to work alongside a very specialized team.
